A set of themes for KDE Plasma designed to give the appearance of Steam's 2003 version, Half-Life's VGUI scheme, or Counter-Strike 1.6's VGUI theme (they're all the same thing).

Window decoration based on PixelOCDGuy's Windows 98 Window Decoration https://github.com/pixelocdguy/windows-classic.
Plasma style based on ABGR's QTStep Classic https://www.opencode.net/abgr/qtstep.
