# Steamed

A global theme for KDE Plasma designed to give the appearance of Steam's 2003 version, Half-Life's VGUI scheme, or Counter-Strike 1.6's VGUI theme (they're all the same thing).  
These were all created for my personal use but I figure there's probably someone else out there who might also want to use it.
